Get rid of displaying the default file in translated records of extbase extensions

20-04-2018 UPDATE:
Forked extension was updated. Now the method can be used to repair display of default data in translated records.
Can be 'configured' by adding your desired tablenames to the `$table` array in [Repair.php](https://github.com/ksickbert-iscope/repair_translation/blob/master/Classes/SignalSlot/Repair.php).
